        <h2>About the Creator: Avengers Fan Page</h2>
        <p>I'm just a girl who likes taking risks and working on herself.</p>
        <p>Exactly 2 weeks ago, I didn't know anything about HTML or CSS, had just been learning other things.</p>
        <p>My world was pretty much filled with warm aroma of coffee, homemade candle making, home exercises, colouring books, the calm of painting and the excitement of getting lost in a good book.</p>
        <p>All my hobbies had to be put on pause, after starting my journey.</p>
        <p>So, why coding? Honestly, I love solving problems and taking up new challenges Coding felt like a perfect adventure.</p>
        <p>The curiousity and hunger to learn brought me here. I've been playing around with all the things I've learned, and it's both challenging and fun once you get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>I'll just say this is my fun little Avengers fan site!</p>
        <p>It might be simple now, but it's the beginning of something exciting. I'm learning every day, and Iâ€™m ready to keep leveling up.</p>
        <p> Thank you for visiting and joining me on this journey. Enjoy the world of superheroes through my eyes.</p>

        <p><b>Sit back and wacth me grow!</b></p>
